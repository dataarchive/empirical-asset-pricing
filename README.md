## Preparatory Stage

* Here I provide the Python code (firstly prepared in 2017) for "Data Analysis for Investment."

* It is based on Guofu Zhou's MATLAB code for that course. You will also see my code in his class.

* The Python distribution I use is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/). 

* The version is Python 3.6.

* I use Jupyter notebooks to interact with Python. 
* To start it, type *jupyter notebook* in a terminal or "Anaconda command prompt" if you use Windows.

* There is a very good tutorial: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/.

* Comments are welcomed.

## FAQs

If you just want to learn some empirical asset pricing, then no additional effort is needed. If you want to learn more, you only need to study *a little bit* harder...

**4. How do we learn?**

You learn by doing, by playing with my code, by googling and by reading documents.
